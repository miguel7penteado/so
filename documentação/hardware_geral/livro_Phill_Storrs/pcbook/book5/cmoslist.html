<TITLE>CMOS, list of addresses</TITLE>

<H2>Phil Storrs PC Hardware book</H2>
<H3>A list of what is in the CMOS</H3>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> where not otherwise noted, all data values are expressed as BYTES - these are eight bit values and are read from MSB to LSB e.g. 0101 1010 binary would be written as 5Ah.

<H4>Organisation of the Real time Clock, 00h to 0Eh</H4>
Addresses 00h to 0Eh within the C-Mos address range are defined by the clock hardware and all manufacturers must follow the original specification set down by IBM. Other manufacturers generally follow the same format as specified for the address region 10h to 2Fh, and some also follow the IBM format for addresses 30h to 33h.
<P>
The first fourteen bytes are dedicated to the MC146818 chip clock functions and consist of ten read/write data registers and four status registers, two of which are read/write and two of which are read only. These first fourteen addresses do not address RAM, they address registers in the Real Time Clock chip.
<P>
<PRE>
The format of the ten clock data registers (bytes 00h-09h) is:
<STRONG>00h </STRONG>Seconds   		(BCD 00-59, Hex 00-3B) Note: Bit 7 is read only      
<STRONG>01h</STRONG> Second Alarm  	(BCD 00-59, Hex 00-3B)      
<STRONG>02h</STRONG> Minutes       	(BCD 00-59, Hex 00-3B))         
<STRONG>03h </STRONG>Minute Alarm  	(BCD 00-59, Hex 00-3B)       
<STRONG>04h </STRONG>Hours         	(BCD 00-23, Hex 00-17 if 24 hr mode)
                   		(BCD 01-12, Hex 01-0C if 12 hr am)
                   		(BCD 81-92. Hex 81-8C if 12 hr pm)         
<STRONG>05h </STRONG>Hour Alarm    	(same as hours)     
<STRONG>06h</STRONG> Day of Week   	(01-07 Sunday=1)    
<STRONG>07h</STRONG> Date of Month 	(BCD 01-31, Hex 01-1F)    
<STRONG>08h</STRONG> Month         	(BCD 01-12, Hex 01-0C)         
<STRONG>09h</STRONG> Year          	(BCD 00-99, Hex 00-63)
         
BCD/Hex selection depends on Bit 2 of register B (0Bh)
12/24 Hr selection depends on Bit 1 of register B (0Bh)
Alarm will trigger when contents of all three Alarm byte registers match
their companions.

The following is the on-chip status register information.
 
<STRONG>0Ah</STRONG> Status Register A (read/write) (usu 26h)
 Bit 7     -(1) time update cycle in progress, data ouputs undefined
		(bit 7 is read only)
 Bit 6,5,4 -22 stage divider. 010b - 32.768 Khz time base for the clock
		(the default value)
 Bit 3-0   - Rate selection bits for interrupt.
		0000b - none
		0011b - 122 microseconds (minimum)
		1111b - 500 milliseconds  
		0110b - 976.562 microseconds (default)

<STRONG>0Bh</STRONG> Status Register B (read/write) 
  Bit 7 - 1 enables cycle update, 0 disables
  Bit 6 - 1 enables periodic interrupt
  Bit 5 - 1 enables alarm interrupt
  Bit 4 - 1 enables update-ended interrupt
  Bit 3 - 1 enables square wave output
  Bit 2 - Data Mode - 0: BCD, 1: Binary
  Bit 1 - 24/12 hour selection - 1 enables 24 hour mode
  Bit 0 - Daylight Savings Enable - 1 enables

<STRONG>0Ch</STRONG> Status Register C (Read only)
  Bit 7 - Interrupt request flag - 1 when any or all of bits 6-4 are 1 
	    and appropriate enables (Register B) are set to 1. 
	    Generates IRQ 8 when triggered.
  Bit 6 - Periodic Interrupt flag
  Bit 5 - Alarm Interrupt flag 
  Bit 4 - Update-Ended Interrupt Flag
  Bit 3-0 ???

<STRONG>0Dh </STRONG>Status Register D (read only)
  Bit 7 - Valid RAM -	1 indicates batery power good, 
				0 if dead or disconnected.
  Bit 6-0 ???
</PRE>
<P>
<H4>Organization of the CMOS Memory</H4>
The last two bytes in the first hexadecimal decade (hexade ?) were not specified in the PC/AT but may have the following use on some systems: (these are 0E and 0Fh)
<P>
<PRE>
<STRONG>0Eh</STRONG> (PS/2) Diagnostic Status Byte 
     Bit 7 - When set (1) indicates clock has lost power
     Bit 6 - (1)	indicates incorrect checksum
     Bit 5 - (1)	indicates that equipment configuration is incorrect 			power-on check requires that atleast one floppy 
			be installed
     Bit 4 - (1)	indicates error in memory size
     Bit 3 - (1)	indicates that controller or disk drive failed 
			initialization
     Bit 2 - (1)	indicates that time is invalid
     Bit 1 - (1)	indicates installed adaptors do not match configuration
     Bit 0 - (1)	indicates a time-out while reading adaptor ID

<STRONG>0Fh </STRONG>Reset Code  (IBM PS/2 "Shutdown Status Byte")
</PRE>
<P>
The next group of values extends from address 10h to 2Dh. <BR>
The word at 2Eh-2Fh is a byte-wise summation of the values in these bytes. Most BIOS's will generate a CMOS Checksum error if this value is invalid however many programs ignore the checksum and report the apparent value. Where a definiton appears universal, no identification is made. Where the definition is thought to be specific to a manufacturer/model 
(AMI, AMSTRAD, IBM AT, IBM PS/2) the identification is enclosed in parens.

PS/2 has provision for 2k of "Expansion CMOS".  The AMI HI-FLEX description is below. If the
