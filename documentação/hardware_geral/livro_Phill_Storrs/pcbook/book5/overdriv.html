<H3>The Intel OverDrive processor</H3></CENTER>
During early 1993 some System Board manufacturers supplied Pentium upgradable System Boards. Intel announced the Pentium OverDrive processor in 1993 but it took nearly two years to deliver a Pentium OverDrive processor. Some System Boards have been advertised as having a Pentium OverDrive socket fitted but unfortunately some of these were released before Intel had finalised the Pin-out of it's Pentium OverDrive Processor. 
<P>
To make the situation even more confusing Intel, in an attempt to make up for the delay in the release of the 64 bit +Pentium  OverDrive chip, did release a 32 bit OverDrive processor called the 486 OverDrive.  Intel produced a range of  Overdrive chips in order to supply upgrade paths for most of the 486 hardware. 486 System Boards could have an 486 OverDrive chip fitted so long as they had :-
<UL>
<LI>a special socket designed for an OverDrive chip
<LI>a 169-pin Intel 486SX or 487 socket
<LI>a 168-pin Intel 486DX socket used for your current CPU.
</UL>

<H4>The type numbers of the common 486 OverDrive processors were:</H4>

<H4>The Pentium OverDrive</H4>
The  Pentium OverDrive chip requires a 237 or 238 pin PGA processor socket. When the Pentium OverDrive chip finally arrived it was discovered not all the System Boards manufactured with a Pentium OverDrive socket would actually work with the chip. <P>
The Pentium OverDrive chips have a fan built into a heatsink on top of the chip but the 486 OverDrive chips only have the heatsink and do not require a fan on the processor chip.
