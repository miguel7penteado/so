<P>
<STRONG>AC/ACL</STRONG> - Advanced CMOS logic, a high speed CMOS logic family.
<P>
<STRONG>Address Space</STRONG> - The amount of memory a CPU is designed to access. Address space is limited by the the size of the address bus available from the processor. 8088/8086 CPUs havd a 20 bit address bus and could access one megabyte (2<SUP>20</SUP> power) of memory.  The 80286 and 80386SX CPUs have a 24 bit address bus and can access 16 megabytes (2<SUP>24</SUP>) of memory. The 80386DX, the 80486 and Pentium processors have a 32 bit address bus and can access more than 4 gigabytes (2<SUP>32</SUP>) of memory.
<P>
<STRONG>ACCESS.bus</STRONG> - A standard desktop high speed four-wire serial bus that was intended to link computers to a wide variety of input and output devices, such as keyboards, mice, bar-code readers, magnetic card readers, scanners and joysticks. As of 1998 it looks as though this technology has died without gaining any significant support and has been replaced by <A HREF="#usb">USB</A> or <A HREF="#fw">FireWire</A>.
<P>
<STRONG>A/D Converter (A to D)</STRONG> - A device that takes analog inputs and converts them to digital signals. For example, a sine wave input can be converted into a series of numbers that represents the value of the input curve at any given point on the curve. The resolution of the converter is determined by the number of bits (the more the better) and the sample rate (the faster the better).
<P>
<STRONG>Asynchronous</STRONG> - Transmission in which each data byte is preceeded by a start bit and followed by one or more stop bits. Data transmission is intermittent with an irregular time interval between data bytes.
<P>
<STRONG>AT computer  (PC/AT)</STRONG> - This is a computer based on the 80286 processor. This processor 16 bit internal and external data buses and a 24 bit address bus. This processor can address up to 16Meg byte of memory. The external bus first used in this computer is called the ISA bus and is still the most common PC bus.
<P>
<STRONG>ATX Format (System Board)</STRONG> - A System Board form factor that has the common I/O port connectors on the back edge of the System Board. See also NLX and Baby AT format.
<P>
<A NAME="b"></A>
<STRONG>Baby AT Format (System Board)</STRONG> - A compact System Board format first used in the late 1980's. This format does not have the common I/O port connectors on the board itself, they must be mounted on the back plane. Like very old PC System Boards, only the Keyboard connector is on the board.
<P>
<A NAME="bsbus"></A><STRONG>Backside bus</STRONG> - A special microprocessor bus inside the processor package that connects the CPU to a Level 2 cache. Typically, a backside bus runs at a faster clock speed than the frontside bus that connects the CPU to the main memory. For example, the Pentium Pro microprocessor actually consists of two chips, one contains the CPU and the primary level 1) cache, and the second contains the secondary (level 2) cache. A backside bus connects the two chips inside the processor package, at the same clock rate as the CPU itself (at least 200 MHz). In contrast, the <A HREF="#fsbus">frontside bus</A> connects the the processor to the outside world and hence the RAM and runs at only a fraction of the CPU clock speed. 
<P>
<STRONG>Baud</STRONG> - the rate of data transmission speed. The number of discrete signal events per second. In asynchronous transmission, baud is the unit of signaling speed corresponding to 1 unit interval per second. Baud is the same as bits per second, if and only if each signal event (1 or 0) represents one data bit exactly. The term <STRONG>Bits Per Second</STRONG> is used today as it is more correct.
<P>
<STRONG>BIOS</STRONG> - The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) routines are stored in ROM memory and provide instructions for system startup and communication with hardware devices.  BIOS routines are stored on a chip and are non-volatile. BIOS routines, like other programs, use memory address locations. Because many of the BIOS routines are not needed at the time DOS is operating, there is the potential to use some of these BIOS addresses for additional high DOS memory.
<P>
<STRONG>BIOS Extension ROM</STRONG> - These are ROMs located on plug in I/O cards inserted into bus slots. They are used to supply BIOS support for devices the computers built in BIOS does not know about. The  most common example of a BIOS Extension ROM is fitted to EGA or VGA video interface cards. The BIOS ROM fitted to all DOS computers does not have routines to handle the more advanced video standards supplied by these cards, the BIOS only knows about CGA and MDA video systems.
<P>
<STRONG>Bisync</STRONG> - An IBM defined byte controlled communications protocol using control characters and synchronized transmission of binary coded data for half-duplex communication between stations. 
Bitstream - Refers to the 1-bit pulse density modulated (PDM) code output from the quantizer in the noise-shaping stage.
<P>
<STRONG>BTL</STRONG> - Backplane Transceiver Logic. Differs from TTL logic levels in that logic High voltage is 2.1 volts and a logic Low voltage is 1 volt, a 1.1 volt swing, versus the 2.4 V TTL minimum swing. Used in Futurebus+ to increase bus speeds and reduce output capacitance and improve noise margin. 
<P>
<STRONG>Bus</STRONG> - a common pathway or channel between hardware devices. Can be serial (information travels one-bit at a time) or parallel (information travels in groups of bits simultaneously moving along multiple parallel paths).
<P>
<A NAME="bust"></A><STRONG>Bus topology</STRONG> (also called <STRONG>Daisy Chain topology</STRONG>): All devices are connected to a central cable, called the bus or backbone. Ethernet systems use a bus topology and Floppy drive and IDE interfaces use this topology as does the SCSI interface.
<P>
<A NAME="c"></A>
<A NAME="cache"></A><STRONG>Cache</STRONG> - A high-speed storage mechanism. It can be either a reserved section of main memory or an independent high-speed storage device. Two types of caching are commonly used in personal computers, <A HREF="#mcache">memory caching</A> and <A HREF="#dcache">disk caching</A>. 
<P>
<STRONG>CAN</STRONG> - Control Area Network. A two-wire serial bus designed to reduce the size of the wiring harness in automobiles. Also used in industrial applications.
<P>
<STRONG>Cards or Boards</STRONG> - These are plug in boards that are used to provide I/O functions in a DOS computer. They are plugged into the Bus Slots in the computers System Board. The most common "cards" found in DOS computers today are the Video Interface card and the IDE/FDC/SPG interface card. This card supplies the hard drive interface (IDE), the floppy disk drive interface (FDC), and the Serial, Parallel and Games ports (SPG).
<P>
<STRONG>Compact Disc ReWriteable (CD-RW)</STRONG> - A new type of CD disk that enables you to write onto it in multiple times. With CD-RW drives and disks, you can treat the optical disk just like a floppy or hard disk, writing data onto it multiple times. The capacity is 650 Meg byte. The first CD-RW drives became available in mid-1997. They are able to read CD-ROMs and can write onto today's CD-R disks, but not on CD-ROMs. Many experts believe that they will be a popular storage medium until DVD devices become widely available. 
<P>
<STRONG>Coaxial Cable</STRONG> - A two-conductor (center conductor and shield) concentric, constant-impedance transmission cable, used for CATV installations and Local Area Networks. Coaxial cable gives very good protection against interference because of its heavy shielding.
<P>
<STRONG>CPU</STRONG> - Central Processing Unit. The functional unit in a processor that does the computing.

<P>
<A NAME="dcache"></A><STRONG>Disk <A HREF="#cache">Caching</A></STRONG> - This works under the same principle as <A HREF="#mcache">Memory Caching</A>, but instead of using high-speed SRAM, a disk cache uses conventional main memory. The most recently accessed data from the disk (as well as adjacent sectors) is stored in a memory buffer. When a program needs to access data from the disk, it first checks the disk cache to see if the data is there. Disk caching improves the performance of the system because accessing data in Cache RAM can be much faster than accessing data on a hard disk drive. 
<P>
<STRONG>DMA</STRONG> - Direct Memory Access. A method in which a device other than the main processor can access main memory directly. It must first obtain control of the bus from the processor or other DMA devices. Then it can read and write to memory directly. This method is a fast method of transferring large amounts of data from a peripheral devoce to the main memory. Using the main processor to handle the data transfer requires more software overhead and reduces system throughput.
<P>
<STRONG>Duplex</STRONG> - Simultaneous two-way independent transmission in both directions. Also known as Full Duplex.
<P>
<STRONG>Digital Versatile Disc (DVD)</STRONG> - The next generation of CDROM device with capacities from 8.4GByte to 17GByte and data transfer rates as high as 10MB/s. A full length movie can be stored on a single DVD disk with several sound tracks and subtitle tracks.
<P>

Some DOS programs could use Expanded Memory for temporary storage to improve performance.  EMS memory can be implemented through memory board hardware using a device driver to provide the EMS services, or by using a memory manager device driver that uses Extended Memory to emulate EMS memory.
<P>
<STRONG>Extended Memory</STRONG> - Memory addressed above the 1 Meg Byte limit of the DOS operating System, imposed by the 20 address lines available to the 8088 processor. This memory is physically addressable by 80286 or later generation CPUs when operating in protected mode.  Extended memory is not normally directly accessible to DOS. Applications and advanced operating systems can make use of memory above one Meg if they are aware of it.
<P>
<STRONG>EEPROM</STRONG> - Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory. Special ROM memory that can be erased and programmed electrically, often the original system socket. Very useful in applications where control bits or small amounts of data must be updated without physically removing the EEPROM device. EPROM - Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory. A special ROM memory that can be erased when exposed to strong doses of ultraviolet (UV) light. After erasing, EPROM memory can be reprogrammed. Erasing requires physically removing the device and placing it under a strong UV light for several minutes. Programing requires placing it into a special PROM programmer.

WHILE and IF... THEN... ELSE. The compiler program takes the instructions and translates them into sequences of 1's and 0's that the CPU can understand. The final output is machine code or binary executable code. For microcontrollers like the 80C51, this code is then placed in ROM or EPROM to control operation of some sysem or device.
<P>
