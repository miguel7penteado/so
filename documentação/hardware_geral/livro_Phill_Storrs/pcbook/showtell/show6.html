<H3>The PC Busses</H3>
A very important feature of PC Computers is the external bus slots into which various I/O cards are plugged. The video interface is usually provided by a card plugged into a bus slot, and most modern PC's also have a sound interface card in a bus slot.
<P>
In the past the serial, parallel, and joystick interfaces were on plug in I/O cards along with hard drive and floppy disk drive interfaces. Over recent years these functions have been included on the system boards but the video and sound functions, and network interfaces are usually still provided by cards plugged into bus slots on the system board.
<P>
Bus technology has undergone a process of evolution made necessary by developments in other areas of PC technology.

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/xt8bit.jpg"><BR>
This is the <B>eight bit external bu</B>s used in the PC and XT type computers</CENTER>
<P>
It provide <STRONG>8 Data lines</STRONG> and <STRONG>20 Address lines</STRONG>, Hardware Interrupt lines and DMA lines<BR>
The bus connectors also provide plus and minus 5 volt, and plus and minus 12 volt, power rails
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/isa1.jpg"><BR>
This is the <B>16 bit external bus</B>, introduced with the PC/AT computer.<BR>
Today it is known as the <B>ISA bus</B> (Industry Standard Architecture)</CENTER>
<P>
This bus provided <STRONG>16 Data lines</STRONG>, <STRONG>24 Address lines</STRONG> and more Interrupt and DMA lines.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/isaxt.jpg"><BR>
This image shows a comparison of the "old" eight bit PC/XT bus and the ISA bus</CENTER>
<P>
The <STRONG>EISA Bus</STRONG> was an alternative advanced Bus devised by the other large computer manufacturers. This bus had the advantage of being able to accept ISA and the original eight bit cards used in the PC/XT computers. The MCA bus was incompatible with other bus types. This example of an EISA Bus card is a SCSI Interface card once used in a powerful Network Server computer.

This is the EISA bus, introduced in 1987 as a competitor to the MCA Bus.</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/eisaisa.jpg"><BR>
This picture shows a comparison of the EISA and ISA bus connectors</CENTER>
<P>
The EISA connector has two rows of contacts, one above the other<BR>
The EISA bus had the advantage of being able to accept ISA bus and eight bit bus cards.
<P>
IBM introduced a new type of bus with its PS/2 range of computers in 1987. This bus is the Micro Channel Architecture, abbreviated to <STRONG>MCA Bus</STRONG>. Here is an example of an MCA Bus Network card out of an IBM PS/2 model 50 computer.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/mca.jpg"><BR>
A MCA Bus card</CENTER>
<P>
The rest of the PC industry did not make much use of IBM's MCA bus, it was too expensive and would not accept any of the existing bus cards in use (the eight bit PC/XT or ISA bus cards)
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/mcaisa1.jpg"><BR>
Here is an ISA bus card compared to an MCA bus card</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/ex33b2.jpg><BR>
Here is the MCA Bus card sitting on top of an ISA bus card for comparison.</CENTER>

<H4>Local Bus technology</H4>
All the popular busses available up to 1994 transferred data at a maximum of 8 MHz. A local bus on the System Board transferred data between the memory and the processor at up to 33 MHz or even higher in some cases. The logical next step was to extend this bus to a series of bus slots and plug I/O cards that required faster transfer rates, like Video Cards, Hard Drive Interfaces, SCSI interfaces and high speed Network cards, into these slots.
<P>
The first attempt at this were proprietary solutions from individual manufacturers. Local Bus technology did not catch on until the Video Electronics Specialists Association (VESA) devised the <STRONG>VESA Local Bus</STRONG>. This example of a VESA Bus card is a Video Interface card.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/isavesa.jpg"><BR>
The VESA Local Bus</CENTER>
<P>
The first universal local bus was the VESA bus, here is a comparison with the ISA Bus<BR>
This bus was soon superceded by the PCI bus, a more advanced and "platform independent" bus
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/pci.jpg"><BR>
Today the PCI local bus has taken over form the VESA local bus</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/ex33c1.jpg><BR>
Here is a ISA Bus card sitting on top of an VESA bus card for comparison.</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/ex33c2.jpg"><BR>
This bus used an MCA type connector on the end of the existing ISA Bus slots.</CENTER> 
<P>
The VESA Local Bus was not used for long, it was soon made obsolete by the <STRONG>PCI Bus</STRONG>. The PCI Bus has the advantage of being used in all modern computer platforms, not only those using Intel family processors.
<P>
When compared to ISA, EISA, MCA and VESA cards, the PCI Bus has the components on the other side of the board.
<P>

The PCI connector is near the back of the board but set in from the ISA Bus connectors.</CENTER>
