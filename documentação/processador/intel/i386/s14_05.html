<H1>14.5  Switching Back to Real-Address Mode</H1>
The processor reenters real-address mode if software clears the PE bit in
CR0 with a 
<A HREF="MOVRS.html">MOV</A> to CR0 instruction. 
A procedure that attempts to do this,
however, should proceed as follows:
<OL>
<LI> If paging is enabled, perform the following sequence:
<UL>
<LI> Transfer control to linear addresses that have an identity mapping;
i.e., linear addresses equal physical addresses.
<LI> Clear the PG bit in CR0.
<LI> Move zeros to CR3 to clear out the paging cache.
</UL>
<LI> Transfer control to a segment that has a limit of 64K (FFFFH). This
loads the CS register with the limit it needs to have in real mode.
<LI> Load segment registers SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS with a selector that
points to a descriptor containing the following values, which are
appropriate to real mode:
<UL>
<LI> Limit = 64K (FFFFH)
<LI> Byte granular (G = 0)
<LI> Expand up (E = 0)
<LI> Writable (W = 1)
<LI> Present (P = 1)
<LI> Base = any value
</UL>
<LI> Disable interrupts. A 
<A HREF="CLI.html">CLI</A> instruction disables INTR interrupts. NMIs
can be disabled with external circuitry.
<LI> Clear the PE bit.
<LI> Jump to the real mode code to be executed using a far 
<A HREF="JMP-2.html">JMP</A>. This
action flushes the instruction queue and puts appropriate values in
the access rights of the CS register.
<LI> Use the 
<A HREF="LGDT.html">LIDT</A> 
instruction to load the base and limit of the real-mode
interrupt vector table.
<LI> Enable interrupts.
<LI> Load the segment registers as needed by the real-mode code.
</OL>
