<H1>Chapter 7  Multitasking</H1>
<P>
To provide efficient, protected multitasking, the 80386 employs several
special data structures. It does not, however, use special instructions to
control multitasking; instead, it interprets ordinary control-transfer
instructions differently when they refer to the special data structures. The
registers and data structures that support multitasking are:
<UL>
<LI>Task state segment
<LI>Task state segment descriptor
<LI>Task register
<LI>Task gate descriptor
</UL>
With these structures the 80386 can rapidly switch execution from one task
to another, saving the context of the original task so that the task can be
restarted later. In addition to the simple task switch, the 80386 offers two
other task-management features:
<OL>
<LI>Interrupts and exceptions can cause task switches (if needed in the
      system design). The processor not only switches automatically to the
      task that handles the interrupt or exception, but it automatically
      switches back to the interrupted task when the interrupt or exception
      has been serviced. Interrupt tasks may interrupt lower-priority
      interrupt tasks to any depth.

<LI>With each switch to another task, the 80386 can also switch to
      another LDT and to another page directory. Thus each task can have a
      different logical-to-linear mapping and a different linear-to-physical
      mapping. This is yet another protection feature, because tasks can be
      isolated and prevented from interfering with one another.
