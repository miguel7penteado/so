<H1>14.4  Entering and Leaving Real-Address Mode</H1>
Real-address mode is in effect after a signal on the RESET pin. Even if the
system is going to be used in protected mode, the start-up program will
execute in real-address mode temporarily while initializing for protected
mode.

<H2>14.4.1  Switching to Protected Mode</H2>
The only way to leave real-address mode is to switch to protected mode. The
processor enters protected mode when a 
<A HREF="MOVRS.html">MOV</A> to CR0 instruction sets the PE
(protection enable) bit in CR0. (For compatibility with the 80286, the LMSW
instruction may also be used to set the PE bit.)
<P>
Refer to 
<A HREF="c10.html">Chapter 10</A>
   "Initialization" for other aspects of switching to
protected mode.
